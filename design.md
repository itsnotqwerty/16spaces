# 16spaces Design Doc

## Built using Deno + Preact
16spaces is a more advanced version of tic-tac-toe played on a 4x4 grid and inspired by the original roman version of tic-tac-toe (terni lapilli)
Players get five "stones" (X's and O's), taking turns placing them on the game board and trying to make 4 in a row 
Once all stones are placed, the only valid move is taking one of your existing pieces and moving it to any unoccupied square that's directly adjacent or diagonal
The game ends when someone gets 4-in-a-row (or runs out of time). There are no draws.
